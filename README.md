# Thinkboard — Notes Application

Deployed at : https://thinkboard.aksoftech.in/

A clean and minimal **thinkboard / notes application** built using the MERN stack, designed for organizing ideas, thoughts, and short-form notes with a simple and intuitive user experience.

## Why this project?

Most notes apps either become bloated or overly simplistic.  
This project focuses on **clarity, responsiveness, and clean data handling**, while serving as a solid full-stack reference implementation using the MERN ecosystem.

It was built to practice:
- End-to-end full-stack development
- RESTful API design
- State management and persistence
- Clean UI + backend separation
